Gerbil: Common Lisp

This is a library that contains versions of Common Lisp-like forms for
use with Gerbil. 

* Introduction

Coming from ~COMMON-LISP~ over to gerbil is fairly
straightforward. Yet, often, one's mind reaches for the known ~CL~
version of things, and not the ~scheme~ or ~gerbil~ implementation.

Thus, the *gerbil-common-lisp* ~gxpkg~ came to fruition.

Common Lisp]].
